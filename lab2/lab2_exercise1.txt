1.Why do we want sometimes to use SetImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
it checks I/O queue and if all I/O queue is processed then it works. 
It mean in case we need to do something after I/O, we can use setImmeadiate.

2. Explain the diffrence between process.nextTick nas setImmediate?
process.nextTick is priority queue and it will be execute before the setImmeadiate in the check queue.
